Concerns have been raised about a potential new tax on Muslims, but the available information does not confirm this. This report aims to provide an overview of the Waqf Amendment Bill 2025 and its implications for Muslims in India.\n\n## Overview of Waqf Amendment Bill 2025\nThe Waqf Amendment Bill 2025 has been passed in both the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha, aiming to reform the management of Waqf properties in India. The bill brings significant changes, including the removal of Section 107 and the application of the Limitation Act 1963 to Waqf Boards. It also modifies the composition of State Waqf Boards and allows for the use of designated properties for affordable housing projects and other social initiatives.\n\nThe bill has sparked controversy, with some Muslims opposing it due to concerns about its impact on institutional autonomy and community rights. However, the government claims that the changes are necessary to root out corruption and promote social welfare, with measures such as greater representation of women in Waqf Boards and support for initiatives like scholarships for Muslim girls.\n\n### Sources\n[1] https://news24online.com/india/waqf-amendment-bill-2025-5-key-reasons-why-muslims-are-angry-about-the-new-changes/519511/\n[2] https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/indias-parliament-passes-controversial-bill-change-muslim-endowments-120436424\n[3] https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/indias-lower-house-passes-controversial-bill-that-would-change-muslim-land-endowments\n[4] https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/4/3/indian-parliaments-lower-house-passes-controversial-muslim-endowments-bill\n[5] https://static.pib.gov.in/WriteReadData/specificdocs/documents/2025/apr/doc202543531701.pdf\n[6] https://ddnews.gov.in/en/understanding-waqf-and-the-2025-amendment-key-reforms-challenges-and-implications/\n[7] https://www.realshepower.in/the-waqf-amendment-bill-2025-analysis/\n[8] https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/waqf-amendment-bill-why-muslims-are-opposing-it/articleshow/119905795.cms\n[9] https://www.onmanorama.com/news/india/2025/04/03/waqf-amendment-bill-key-provisions-non-muslim-members-wakf-tribunal-changes-explained.html\n[10] https://www.livemint.com/politics/news/waqf-bill-in-lok-sabha-a-complete-guide-to-controversy-amendments-and-nda-vs-india-showdown-11743557815392.html\n\n## New Income Tax Bill 2025\nThe New Income Tax Bill 2025 is a proposed legislation aimed at modernizing India's tax system. However, the recent controversy surrounding the Waqf Amendment Bill has sparked concerns among Muslims about potential control over their properties. The Waqf Amendment Bill allows for the removal of Section 107 and brings the Waqf Board under the purview of the Limitation Act 1963, giving the government greater control over Muslim properties.\n\nThe bill has been met with opposition, with many fearing it will give the Hindu nationalist government greater control over Muslim properties. The New Income Tax Bill 2025 itself focuses on simplifying tax laws and reducing litigation, but its relevance to the topic of a new tax on Muslims is unclear.\n### Sources\n[1] https://www.jagranjosh.com/general-knowledge/what-is-the-new-income-tax-bill-explained-1739197540-1\n[2] https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/new-income-tax-bill-2025-explained-top-30-faqs-every-taxpayer-should-check/articleshow/118242116.cms\n[3] https://www.india-briefing.com/news/indias-new-income-tax-bill-2025-an-overview-36160.html/\n[4] https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/4/3/indian-parliaments-lower-house-passes-controversial-muslim-endowments-bill\n[5] https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/indias-lower-house-passes-controversial-bill-that-would-change-muslim-land-endowments\n[6] https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/modi-government-ignores-anti-muslim-outcry-as-lok-sabha-passes-waqf-amendment-bill-2025/cid/2092118\n[7] https://news24online.com/india/waqf-amendment-bill-2025-5-key-reasons-why-muslims-are-angry-about-the-new-changes/519511/\n[8] https://frontline.thehindu.com/politics/waqf-amendment-bill-2024-parliament-debate-nda-vs-india-impact-muslims/article69401154.ece\n[9] https://gulfnews.com/world/asia/india/what-is-waqf-amendment-bill-2024-key-changes-and-their-impact-on-governance-and-property-management-1.500081903\n[10] https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy744983e3o\n[11] https://apnews.com/article/india-muslim-endowments-waqf-parliament-4fb3ce70dbd2e579bccc43ce1e245f6d\n[12] https://www.realclearreligion.org/2025/04/03/india_passes_controversial_bill_that_would_change_muslim_endowments_1101782.html\n\n## Comparison and Analysis\nThe Waqf (Amendment) Bill 2025 and the New Income Tax Bill 2025 have been subjects of intense debate in India.
